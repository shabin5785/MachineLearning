-Two major types of problems in machine learning depending on type of output. Classification Problem and Regression Problem. Classification problem the value of output belongs to a discrete/finite set ( like true or false or 50 or will not rain etc, spam or not, pass or fail). Regression problem output belongs to a continous set (like between 2 and 10 ),

- All inputs to a machine learning problem solution are called as features while the output values is called as label.

- we decide the inputs taht lead to a output, decide the kind of problem ( classificaion or regression) , decide an algorithm and then apply it on features to get the label.

- K nearest neigbour algorthm: Data that are nearby or similar will most probably belong to the same set
